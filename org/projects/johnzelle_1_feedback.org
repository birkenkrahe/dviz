* Problem:
This project involves creating one or more scatter plots using Excel
to visualize the Twitch subscriber count across different days of the
week. By plotting the data points on a graph, we can effectively
analyze the trends and patterns in subscriber counts over time. This
visualization will provide valuable insights into the popularity of
the Twitch channel on specific days of the week, helping the channel
owner make informed decisions on content scheduling and audience
engagement strategies. Through the scatter plot analysis, we can
identify peak days of subscriber growth, as well as any potential
patterns or anomalies that may impact the channel's overall
performance. Overall, this project aims to leverage data visualization
techniques to enhance the understanding of Twitch subscriber behavior.

* Reasons:
Understanding which streaming platform stands out in terms of
influence and effectiveness is valuable for multiple stakeholders like
consumers and creators. For consumers, it gives ideas about the
platform which provide proper and good content without unnecessary
content. It also gives the best idea to choose which platform and
which services to use. For creators, it helps identify best platform
to partner with based on reach and engagement on them.

* Constraints:
- Technical: Some platforms may not provide every data to
  public. Combining data from different source may require significant
  effort in terms of standardizing formats and handling
  inconsistencies.
- Conceptual: Choosing the right metrics to measure influence and
  effectiveness can be a little subjective and may vary based on each
  perspective.
- Personal: Specific skills and tools may need for advance
  analysis. Time management can be another one.

* Goals:
- The goals of this visualization are to identify any patterns or
  trends in sub counts based on the day of the week, as well as to
  compare the performance of the channel on different days. By
  examining the data in this format, we can gain valuable insights
  into the audience behavior and preferences, which can inform content
  scheduling and marketing strategies.
- Non-Goals: Using the data of only five years (which may change in
  future but never above 5).  Technical performance reviews of the
  platforms are not part of the scope.  Only the top three platforms
  will be given priority and not others.

* Metrics
Change in the consumer numbers.
Annual revenue figures and growth rates.
Number of titles and genres available.
Overall market share relative to other platforms.

* References:

- Software: R and its packages (some) (https://www.R-project.org)
- Emacs.
- Litmaps Statista (Portal for market data)
- Nielsen (Portal with insights about what people watch and listen)

#+begin_notes
This is better than the proposal in the other class. I changed the
Org-mode layout a bit: with =*= you can create headlines, and with =-= you
can create bullet points. Improvement: the references are not
consistent or complete. "Emacs" is not a reference, and you need more
than the name of a platform (like Litmaps). Also, you need more
references for the work itself (where do the data come from, what
other studies are there that do try to do similar things etc.).

What is confusing is that you want to visualize in Excel (why?) but
you cite R. You should, if you can, make visualizations in R.
