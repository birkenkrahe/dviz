* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

This course focuses on visualizing data. There are many tools and
platforms out there to visualize patterns found in data and tell
engaging, convincing stories. As a data scientist, you have to know
what's out there, understand the principles of good visual
presentation, and be able to customize plots quickly.

In this course, we look at popular platforms like Tableau and R Shiny,
and at different packages within R.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack.

Visualization of data-driven insights and improved productivity when
working with data and media is a concern for any professional.

In this course, we use R (and some Python), which is easier to learn
for students outside of computer science.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Data visualization" (DSC 302) will be
able to:

- Learn about, and use popular data science visualization platforms
- Understand how to visualiye exploratory data analysis results
- Apply literate programming principles to their work with Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Emacs, and GitHub
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

This introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis prepares course
participants for taking DSC 305, "Machine learning".

* Course requirements

Introduction to programming (CSC 100 or CSC 115). Some knowledge of,
and experience with programming and using the R language is useful but
not critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data literacy
skills by taking this course. The course will prepare you for further
studies in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use
modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* Grading system

* A note on using AI to write code for you or debug your code

*Short summary:* For students, using AI is a waste of time at best, and
a crime against your ability to learn at worst. Learning never comes
without pain and (temporary) desperation. AI is like a pill but one
that only works some of the time, and you'll never know when. Instead:
join Lyon's Programming Student Club and experience the pain of not
knowing first hand every week!

*Will you be punished for using AI in my class?* Not directly because
nobody can tell if you used AI or not but indirectly by turning in
suboptimal results, by learning less, and by having less time for
other, more productive activities.

*Are there any data on this?* Not much on coding as such but a recent
(15 July), substantive, long (59 p) paper titled "Generative AI Can
Harm Learning"), based on a very carefully conducted field experiment
with a large (1000) sample of high school students concluded: "Our
results suggest that students attempt to use [AI] as a "crutch" during
practice problem sessions, and when successful, perform worse on their
own. Thus, to maintain long-term productivity, we must be cautious
when deploying generative AI to ensure humans continue to learn
critical skills."  ([[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4895486&s=03][Bastani et al, 2024]]).
