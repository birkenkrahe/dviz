* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

This course focuses on visualizing data. There are many tools and
platforms out there to visualize patterns found in data and tell
engaging, convincing stories. As a data scientist, you have to know
what's out there, understand the principles of good visual
presentation, and be able to customize plots quickly.

In this course, we look at popular platforms like Tableau and R Shiny,
at different packages within R, and at data visualization with Python.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack.

Visualization of data-driven insights and improved productivity when
working with data and media is a concern for any professional.

In this course, we use R (and some Python), which is especially easy
for students who are not computer scientists.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Data visualization" (DSC 302) will be
able to:

- Learn about, and use popular data science visualization platforms
- Understand how to visualiye exploratory data analysis results
- Apply literate programming principles to their work with Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Emacs, and GitHub
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

This introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis prepares course
participants for taking DSC 305, "Machine learning" (with R).

* Course requirements

Introduction to programming (CSC 100 or CSC 115 or CSC 109). Some
knowledge of, and experience with programming and using the R language
is useful but not critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data
literacy skills by taking this course. The course will prepare you for
further studies in computer and data science, or in other disciplines
that use modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to
zoology).

* Grading system

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION           | IMPACT |
|---------+-----------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | DataCamp assignments  |    25% |
| Monthly | Sprint reviews        |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                 |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional) |    25% |

- Sprint reviews are monthly project progress reports
- Tests are open-book multiple choice exams for home
- The final exam is optional if you want to improve your grade

* Rubric
#+attr_html: :width 400px:

* Learning management system

- We use Lyon's Canvas installation for this course.
- The home page contains: assignments, grades, pages, people,
  syllabus, quizzes, Google Drive, Course evaluation and Zoom.
- The Zoom page includes cloud recordings of all past sessions.
- Recorded sessions will be deleted after the last class.

* GitHub

All course materials are available in a public GitHub repository
([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz24][github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz24]]). Registration for students includes a
free subscription to GitHub codespaces with the AI coding assistant
Copilot. GitHub is the worldwide largest online platform for software
development.

* A note on using AI to write code for you or debug your code

[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.pdf][See full PDF on GitHub.]]

*Short summary:* For students, using AI is a waste of time at best, and
a crime against your ability to learn at worst. Learning never comes
without pain and (temporary) desperation. AI is like a pill but one
that only works some of the time, and you'll never know when. Instead:
join Lyon's Programming Student Club and experience the pain of not
knowing first hand every week!

Will you be punished for using AI in my class?*

Not directly because nobody can tell if you used AI or not but
indirectly by turning in suboptimal results, by learning less, and
by having less time for other, more productive activities.


*Are there any data on this?*

Not much on coding as such but a recent (15 July), substantive, long
(59 p) paper titled "Generative AI Can Harm Learning"), based on a
very carefully conducted field experiment with a large (1000) sample
of high school students concluded: "Our results suggest that students
attempt to use [AI] as a "crutch" during practice problem sessions,
and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain
long-term productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative
AI to ensure humans continue to learn critical skills."  ([[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4895486&s=03][Bastani et
al, 2024]]).
