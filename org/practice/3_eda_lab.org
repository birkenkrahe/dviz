In the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/2_data_eda_R.org][last lecture]], you saw [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/img/2_brain.png][some plots]] from the ~mammals~ data frame of
the ~MASS~ package, giving body weights and brain weights for 62
animals.

[[../../img/2_brain.png]]

The ~Animals2~ data frame from the ~robustbase~ package gives the same
characterizations for a different set of animals.

In both cases, the row names for these data frames identify these
animals, and the objective of this exercise is to examine the
differences between the animals characterized in these data frames:

1) Make the required packages available.

   /Tip: packages need to be installed (once) and loaded (per session)./

   Use this code block to start a session and run the necessary commands:

   #+begin_src R :session :results silent
     ...
   #+end_src

   Remember when asked to start the session in the same directory
   where your practice file resides.

   ----- SOLUTION -----

   - Install ~MASS~ and ~robustbase~ install using ~install.packages~. You
     have to do this only once (unless you upgrade or change your
     version of R).

   - Load the packages.
     #+begin_src R :session :results output
       library(MASS)
       library(robustbase)
     #+end_src

2) The ~rownames~ function returns a vector or row names for a data
   frame, and the ~intersect~ function computes the intersection of two
   sets, returning a vector of their common elements.

   Using these functions, construct and display the vector
   ~commonAnimals~ of animal names common to both data frames.

   How many animals are included in this set? Tip: you can check the
   length of a vector with the function ~length~.

   ----- SOLUTION -----

   - Check both data frames with ~str~.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       str(Animals2)
       str(mammals)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 'data.frame':    65 obs. of  2 variables:
     :  $ body : num  1.35 465 36.33 27.66 1.04 ...
     :  $ brain: num  8.1 423 119.5 115 5.5 ...
     : 'data.frame':    62 obs. of  2 variables:
     :  $ body : num  3.38 0.48 1.35 465 36.33 ...
     :  $ brain: num  44.5 15.5 8.1 423 119.5 ...

   - Look at row names with ~rownames~.

     #+begin_src R :session :results silent
       rownames(Animals2)
       rownames(mammals)
     #+end_src

   - Check the use of ~intersect~ with ~help(intersect)~.

   - Store the intersection using ~intersect~ in ~commonAnimals~.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results silent
       commonAnimals <- intersect(rownames(Animals2), rownames(mammals))
       commonAnimals
     #+end_src

   - Check the length of ~commonAnimals~ with ~length~ or ~str~.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       length(commonAnimals)
       str(commonAnimals)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : [1] 58
     :  chr [1:58] "Mountain beaver" "Cow" "Grey wolf" "Goat" "Guinea pig" "Asian elephant" "Donkey" "Horse" "Cat" ...

3) The ~setdiff~ function returns a vector of elements contained in one
   set but not in the other: ~setdiff(A,B)~~ returns a vector of
   elements in set ~A~ that are not in set ~B~.

   Use ~setdiff~ to display the animals present in ~mammals~ that are *not*
   present in ~Animals2~.

   ----- SOLUTION -----

   #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
     setdiff(rownames(mammals), rownames(Animals2))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Arctic fox"             "Arctic ground squirrel" "Patas monkey"           "Mole rat"

4) Use ~setdiff~ to display the animals present in ~Animals2~ that are *not*
   present in ~mammals~.

   ----- SOLUTION -----

   #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
     setdiff(rownames(Animals2), rownames(mammals))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Dipliodocus"           "Potar monkey"          "Triceratops"           "Brachiosaurus"
   : [5] "Mole"                  "Artic fox"             "Artic ground squirrel"

5) Can you give a simple (qualitative) characterization of these
   differences between the two sets of animals?

   /Tip: you have to look at the output of the last two tasks to
   identify these differences./

   ----- SOLUTION -----

   1. The ~Animals2~ data frame contains three dinosaurs ("Triceratops",
      "Dipliodocus", and "Brachiosaurus")

   2. The word "Arctic" is misspelled in ~Animals2~ - "Arctic fox" and
      "Arctic ground squirrel" are actually in both data frames.

   3. ~mammals~ lists "Mole rat" while ~Animals2~ lists "Mole" but body
      and brain weights are the same:

      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
        mammals["Mole rat",]
        Animals2["Mole",]
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      :           body brain
      : Mole rat 0.122     3
      :       body brain
      : Mole 0.122     3

      More detailed using ~which~ for indices and ~rownames~ with ~==~:
      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
        mammals[which(rownames(mammals) == "Mole rat"),]
        Animals2[which(rownames(Animals2) == "Mole"),]
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      :           body brain
      : Mole rat 0.122     3
      :       body brain
      : Mole 0.122     3

   4. ~mammals~ lists "Patas monkey" while ~Animals2~ lists "Potar monkey" but body
      and brain weights are the same:

      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
        mammals["Patas monkey",]
        Animals2["Potar monkey",]
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      :              body brain
      : Patas monkey   10   115
      :              body brain
      : Potar monkey   10   115

6) Make some meaningful plots! (Next week.)
