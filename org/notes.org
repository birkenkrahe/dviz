This file, =notes.org= ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/main/org/notes.org][GitHub]]) contains a log of class activities.

** Project: published [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2629/assignments/32827][1st sprint review instructions]] - get cracking!

** Review questions:

1. What is data science mainly concerned with?
   #+begin_quote
   Data science is mainly concerned with identifying patterns in data
   and interpreting or predicting them.
   #+end_quote
2. Characterize Minard's 1869 chart - how would you describe it in
   your own words?
   #+attr_html: :width 700px:
   [[../img/1_minard.png]]
   #+begin_quote
   The chart ("tableau graphique") is a kind of (1) "Sankey diagram"
   used even today to (2) visualize flow, the change of a quantity
   over time - in this case the dwindling size of Napoleon's army
   during the 1812-1813 Russia campaign that ended with his occupation
   of a (burning) Moscow. Other data shown: (3) geography (location
   and distance), (4) temperature changes along the way, time (during
   the campaign). Fun fact: These diagrams are named after the British
   engineer, who used it in 1898 to represent energy efficiency of a
   steam engine to illustrate how energy was conserved or lost during
   operation ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram#/media/File:JIE_Sankey_V5_Fig1.png][see here]]). It's used by Google (see: [[https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey][Google Charts]]).
   #+end_quote
3. (*Discuss with your neighbor:*) How would you rate the quality of
   Minard's chart as a data visualiation - what's good and what's
   perhaps not so good about it?
   #+begin_quote
   | PROS                                         | CONS                                   |
   |----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
   | Brings many different kinds of data together | We're not told where the data are from |
   | Color is used sparingly, focus is on flow    | The chart is in French only            |
   | You can grasp the story with one glance      | Temperature is given in Reaumur        |
   | The chart looks aesthetically pleasing       | The artistic quality is distracting    |
   #+end_quote
4. What are the stages of the "data pipeline"?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Data storage and transformation
   2. Data modeling
   3. Data analysis (EDA)
   4. Data visualization
   5. Data storytelling (insights)
   #+end_quote
5. Which popular commercial data visualization tools do you know?
   #+begin_quote
   *Tableau* (by Salesforce) and *Power BI* (by Microsoft) are the two
   most popular (in business) data visualization tools. They are
   essentially dashboards with integrated data analysis tools. In this
   course, you will get an introduction to Power BI. Another
   super-useful skill is *CAD/CAM* (Computer-Aided Design /
   Computer-Aided Manufacturing). Some of our graduates learnt it in
   high school (!) and used it to enter successful careers. Perhaps we
   can get them to come back and do a workshop for us - any interest?

6. What is the main purpose of computing trendlines?
   #+begin_quote
   The main purpose of computing trendlines is to draw statistical
   conclusions from sample data. Here, "statistical" means both using
   mathematical methods in statistics, and "based on probability
   theory" and certain assumptions, which are encapsulated in the
   sample data, especially in its features and records.
   #+end_quote

** Codealong: A simple trendline example using =mtcars= data

See =2_trendline.org= ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/main/org/2_trendline.org][GitHub]])

** Review questions - Shell

1. Login Google Cloud Shell
   #+begin_quote
   URL: =shell.cloud.google.com= or =cloud.google.com/shell=
   #+end_quote
2. Plot directly from the R console
   #+begin_quote
   > png("random.png")    # prepare graphics file (don't create it)
   > plot(rnorm(1000))    # plot 1000 random points to file
   > dev.off()            # close graphics device
   #+end_quote
3. What does the GitHub Hello World Project consist of?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Create a =public= repo[sitory] =hello-world= with a =README= file, a
      =.gitignore= template, and a copyright =LICENSE= file.
   2. Create a new branch called =readme-edits= besides the =main= branch.
   3. Make a change to =README.md= in the =readme-edits= branch.
   4. =Commit= the change (the branches have now diverged).
   5. The =main= branch now has a =pull= request for the changes made.
   6. After checking out the changes, the branches are =merged=.

   Demo: remote updating with =git= on the command-line.
   #+end_quote
4. How can you check in Linux if R is available?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     which R      # location of the program (Linux only)
     R --version  # version of the installed program
     R --vanilla  # start R without an environment (for demo only)
   #+end_src
5. How can you get R? (In Linux or Windows)
   #+begin_quote
   - Linux command-line, run =sudo apt install r-base -y=
   - In Windows: download R binary from r-projects.org
   #+end_quote
6. What is =ess=?
   #+begin_quote
   "Emacs Speaks Statistics" (see [[https://ess.r-project.org][ess.r-project.org]]) is an Emacs
   package that connects Emacs and R so that R can be run inside Emacs
   (also works for other statistical analysis programs).
   #+end_quote
7. How can you get =ess=?
   #+begin_quote
   - Run =M-x list-packages= inside Emacs
   - Find (=C-s=) the =ess= package
   - Mark for install with =i=
   - Run install with =x=
   #+end_quote
8. What is R's workspace?
   #+begin_quote
   The workspace is where all user-defined variables or functions are
   stored to be loaded when R is started next. You can opt to not save
   the workspace when you leave the R console with =q()=.
   #+end_quote
9. How does an R source code block in Org-mode look like?
   #+begin_example Org
     #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output
       ## code
     #+end_src
   #+end_example
10. What is needed to compute & plot a trendline model on a dataset?
    #+begin_quote
    Four R functions:
    1) A dataset (=data=)
    2) A plotting function (=plot=)
    3) A linear regression model function (=lm=)
    4) A way to draw the trendline (=abline=)

- [ ] Review: First DataCamp lesson
- [ ] Google Colab coding platform
- [ ] Catching up (or moving fasteR) on R
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis with R

* TODO Review: DataCamp's "Visualizing distributions"

*Note:* For the test, you need to know all the concepts mentioned in the
DataCamp lesson, not only the ones that we're reviewing here.

/Fire up your Emacs Org-mode file testR.org to code along./ For a
different experience, use Google Colab at [[https://colab.research.google.com/][colab.research.google.com]].

1. What is a "data distribution"?
   #+begin_quote
   A data distribution is a collection of data points (literally
   points, e.g. (x,y) in the plane) exhibiting a pattern in terms of
   - Centrality (indicating where the data are centered)
   - Spread (degree of distance from the center)
   - Shape (or Gestalt - symmetry)
   - Outliers (points not part of the "central" pattern)
   - Underlying probabilistic distribution (e.g. Gaussian distribution)
   #+end_quote
2. How can you gain insights into data distributions?
   #+begin_quote
   - By calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
   - By running models (linear and logistic regression)
   - By drawing plots (e.g. scatterplots, histograms, barplots)
   #+end_quote
3. What is the "Datasaurus Dozen"?
   #+begin_quote
   The "Datasaurus Dozen" is a dataset created to illustrate the
   importance of visualizing data before analyzing it. The data have
   almost identical summary statistics but totally different visual
   patterns. The data are the bigger version of the "Anscombe
   quartet".
   #+end_quote
   
   #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
     data(anscombe)
     summary(anscombe)
   #+end_src
4. What's the difference between continuous and categorical
   variables - can you give examples for each?
   #+begin_quote
   - Continous variables are usually numeric from the (mathematical )
     set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Example: temperature, height.
   - Categorical variables are from a finite, discrete subset that can
     be mapped onto the set of whole numbers $\mathbb{Z}$ (though the
     mapping is more meaningful for ordered sets). Example: countries.
   - In R, categorical variables are represented as =factor= vectors.
   #+end_quote

5. When should you use a histogram and what are you looking for?
   #+begin_quote
   You use histograms to visualize frequencies (counts) of a single,
   continuous variable. Example: water flow through the river =Nile=.

   You're looking for the shape of the frequency distribution.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src R :file nile.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
     hist(Nile)
   #+end_src

6. When should you use a boxplot (cat-and-whiskers)?
   #+begin_quote
   You use a boxplot to visualize the distribution of a continuous
   variable split by a categorical variable.

   You use boxplots e.g. to compare the distributions of the
   continuous variable for each category. Example: =ToothGrowth= length
   of Guinea Pigs by vitamin C source =supp=.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src R :file tg.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
     data(ToothGrowth)
     tg <- ToothGrowth
     boxplot(tg$len ~ tg$supp)
   #+end_src

- What if you don't know any R at all?
  #+begin_quote
  I will introduce the necessary commands to you. Vectors and data
  frames are the only data structures that you need, and loops are not
  needed because *vectorization* and the =apply= functions are available.
  #+end_quote

- What if I feel I need more R
  #+begin_quote
  Complete the DataCamp course "Introduction to R" in 2-4 hours on
  your own. If you're in DSC 105, you need to complete this anyway.
  #+end_quote

- What if I don't like DataCamp or I want to move faster?
  #+begin_quote
  Fork & work through Norm Matloff's "fasteR" tutorial on GitHub at
  [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][github.com/matloff/fasteR]]. It's the best resource for non-comp-sci
  people available. Matloff is a statistician + computer scientist + R
  champion. His book "The Art of R Programming" is a jewel, too.
