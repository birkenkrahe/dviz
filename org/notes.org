This file, =notes.org= ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/main/org/notes.org][GitHub]]) contains a log of class activities.

* DONE Project: published [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2629/assignments/32827][1st sprint review instructions]] - get cracking!

* DONE Review questions:

1. What is data science mainly concerned with?
   #+begin_quote
   Data science is mainly concerned with identifying patterns in data
   and interpreting or predicting them.
   #+end_quote
2. Characterize Minard's 1869 chart - how would you describe it in
   your own words?
   #+attr_html: :width 700px:
   [[../img/1_minard.png]]
   #+begin_quote
   The chart ("tableau graphique") is a kind of (1) "Sankey diagram"
   used even today to (2) visualize flow, the change of a quantity
   over time - in this case the dwindling size of Napoleon's army
   during the 1812-1813 Russia campaign that ended with his occupation
   of a (burning) Moscow. Other data shown: (3) geography (location
   and distance), (4) temperature changes along the way, time (during
   the campaign). Fun fact: These diagrams are named after the British
   engineer, who used it in 1898 to represent energy efficiency of a
   steam engine to illustrate how energy was conserved or lost during
   operation ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram#/media/File:JIE_Sankey_V5_Fig1.png][see here]]). It's used by Google (see: [[https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey][Google Charts]]).

3. (*Discuss with your neighbor:*) How would you rate the quality of
   Minard's chart as a data visualiation - what's good and what's
   perhaps not so good about it?
   #+begin_quote
   | PROS                                         | CONS                                   |
   |----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
   | Brings many different kinds of data together | We're not told where the data are from |
   | Color is used sparingly, focus is on flow    | The chart is in French only            |
   | You can grasp the story with one glance      | Temperature is given in Reaumur        |
   | The chart looks aesthetically pleasing       | The artistic quality is distracting    |
   #+end_quote
4. What are the stages of the "data pipeline"?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Data storage and transformation
   2. Data modeling
   3. Data analysis (EDA)
   4. Data visualization
   5. Data storytelling (insights)
   #+end_quote
5. Which popular commercial data visualization tools do you know?
   #+begin_quote
   *Tableau* (by Salesforce) and *Power BI* (by Microsoft) are the two
   most popular (in business) data visualization tools. They are
   essentially dashboards with integrated data analysis tools. In this
   course, you will get an introduction to Power BI. Another
   super-useful skill is *CAD/CAM* (Computer-Aided Design /
   Computer-Aided Manufacturing). Some of our graduates learnt it in
   high school (!) and used it to enter successful careers. Perhaps we
   can get them to come back and do a workshop for us - any interest?

6. What is the main purpose of computing trendlines?
   #+begin_quote
   The main purpose of computing trendlines is to draw statistical
   conclusions from sample data. Here, "statistical" means both using
   mathematical methods in statistics, and "based on probability
   theory" and certain assumptions, which are encapsulated in the
   sample data, especially in its features and records.
   #+end_quote

* IN PROGRESS Codealong: A simple trendline example using =mtcars= data

See =2_trendline.org= ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/main/org/2_trendline.org][GitHub]])

** Review questions
1. Login Google Cloud Shell
   #+begin_quote
   URL: =shell.cloud.google.com= or =cloud.google.com/shell=
   #+end_quote
2. Plot directly from the R console
   #+begin_quote
   > png("random.png")    # prepare graphics file (don't create it)
   > plot(rnorm(1000))    # plot 1000 random points to file
   > dev.off()            # close graphics device
   #+end_quote
3. What does the GitHub Hello World Project consist of?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Create a =public= repo[sitory] =hello-world= with a =README= file, a
      =.gitignore= template, and a copyright =LICENSE= file.
   2. Create a new branch called =readme-edits= besides the =main= branch.
   3. Make a change to =README.md= in the =readme-edits= branch.
   4. =Commit= the change (the branches have now diverged).
   5. The =main= branch now has a =pull= request for the changes made.
   6. After checking out the changes, the branches are =merged=.

   Demo: remote updating with =git= on the command-line.
   #+end_quote
4. How can you check in Linux if R is available?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     which R      # location of the program
     R --version  # version of the installed program
     R --vanilla  # start R without an environment (for demo only)
   #+end_src
5. How can you get R?
   #+begin_quote
   On the command-line, run =sudo apt install r-base -y=
   #+end_quote
6. What is =ess=?
   #+begin_quote
   "Emacs Speaks Statistics" (see [[https://ess.r-project.org][ess.r-project.org]]) is an Emacs
   package that connects Emacs and R so that R can be run inside Emacs
   (also works for other statistical analysis programs).
   #+end_quote
7. How can you get =ess=?
   #+begin_quote
   - Run =M-x list-packages= inside Emacs
   - Find (=C-s=) the =ess= package
   - Mark for install with =i=
   - Run install with =x=
   #+end_quote
8. What is R's workspace?
   #+begin_quote
   The workspace is where all user-defined variables or functions are
   stored to be loaded when R is started next. You can opt to not save
   the workspace when you leave the R console with =q()=.
   #+end_quote
9. How does an R source code block in Org-mode look like?
   #+begin_example Org
     #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output
       ## code
     #+end_src
   #+end_example
10. What is needed to compute & plot a trendline model on a dataset?
    #+begin_quote
    Four R functions:
    1) A dataset (=data=)
    2) A plotting function (=plot=)
    3) A linear regression model function (=lm=)
    4) A way to draw the trendline (=abline=)
