What we achieved in our first session: Course orientation, and
critical discussion of a few visualization examples.

* Week 2 - What is Data Visualization & =mtcars= Demo

** Project: published [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2629/assignments/32827][1st sprint review instructions]] - get cracking!

** Review questions:

1. What is data science mainly concerned with?
   #+begin_quote
   Data science is mainly concerned with identifying patterns in data
   and interpreting or predicting them.

2. Characterize Minard's 1869 chart - how would you describe it in
   your own words?

   #+begin_quote
   The chart ("tableau graphique") is a kind of "Sankey diagram" used
   even today to visualize flow, the change of a quantity over time -
   in this case the dwindling size of Napoleon's army during the
   1812-1813 Russia campaign that ended with his occupation of a
   (burning) Moscow. Other data shown: geography (location and
   distance), temperature changes along the way, time (during the
   campaign). Fun fact: These diagrams are named after the British
   engineer, who used it in 1898 to represent energy efficiency of a
   steam engine to illustrate how energy was conserved or lost during
   operation ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram#/media/File:JIE_Sankey_V5_Fig1.png][see here]]). It's used by Google (see: [[https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey][Google Charts]]).

3. What are the stages of the "data pipeline"?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Data storage and transformation
   2. Data modeling
   3. Data analysis (EDA)
   4. Data visualization
   5. Data storytelling (insights)
   #+end_quote
4. Which popular commercial data visualization tools do you know?
   #+begin_quote
   Tableau (by Salesforce) and Power BI (by Microsoft) are the two
   most popular (in business) data visualization tools. They are
   essentially dashboards with integrated data analysis tools. In this
   course, you will get an introduction to Power BI. Another
   super-useful skill is CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design /
   Computer-Aided Manufacturing). Some of our graduates learnt it in
   high school (!) and used it to enter successful careers. Perhaps we
   can get them to come back and do a workshop for us - any interest?

5. What is the main purpose of computing trendlines?
   #+begin_quote
   The main purpose of computing trendlines is to draw statistical
   conclusions from sample data. Here, "statistical" means both using
   mathematical methods in statistics, and "based on probability
   theory" and certain assumptions, which are encapsulated in the
   sample data, especially in its features and records.
